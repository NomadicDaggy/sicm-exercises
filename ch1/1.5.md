# Exercise 1.5

## What behaviour will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?

With applicative order, the evaluation of expressions happens iteratively - at the moment the value is requested. In this case (= x 0) will evaluate to true and return x which is 0.

## what behaviour with normal-order evaluation?

With normal evaluation everything is evaluated as is, so we would get:

    `if (= 0 0) 0 (p)`

It would want to evaluate (p), but be unable, because the `if` operator takes only values - no expressions. So it would throw an error.
