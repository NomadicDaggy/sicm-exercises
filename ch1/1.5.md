# Exercise 1.5

## What behaviour will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?

With applicative order, the arguments of a procedure are evaluated, before applying the procedure. So `(test 0 (p))` would try to evaluate `(p)` and hang in an infinite loop.

## what behaviour with normal-order evaluation?

With normal evaluation everything is fully expanded before evaluation, so we would get:

    `(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))`

At this point, it seemed at first intuitive to me that it would again be stuck trying to expand (p). This would not happen though, the expansion just means that (p) gets replaced with (p) per its definition. Since `if` only evaluates one branch, in this case the predicate is true and so 0 is evaluated and returned, not even touching (p).
